Splunk > Open Source FTW!


---------------------------------------------
Requirements & Assumptions
---------------------------------------------
1. You're a sysadmin
2. You have a MediaWiki system at the ready. Beta 1 only tested with MW 1.16.4
  (http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-1.16.4.tar.gz)
3. You can update apache's conf files for the media wiki vhost
4. You can run SQL commands on the MediaWiki DB
5. You know this is Beta ;)
6. You promise to read AND follow all these steps IN ORDER
7. You've made a backup of your mediawiki DB in case you didn't meet the
   previous requirement

It is further assumed that have 4 classes of users of your wiki:

* Anonymous and guests who are logged in - these are folks who fall into the *
  (default) or "user" group.  They can *only* read and can not edit any pages.
* Employees - folks who are in the "Employee" group and can edit any single page
  but not use any advanced PonyDoc functions like creating TOCs, Versions and
  Branching or inheriting
* Editors - folks who can do it all, short of editing user perms and are in the
  "PRODUCT-docteam" group. There is a per product docteam group so if you had a
  product called "Foo", the editor would need to be in the "Foo-docteam" group
* Admins - folks who can add and remove Employees and Editors to the different
  product docteam groups

---------------------------------------------
Quick Install Instructions
---------------------------------------------

Notes: Please complete all install instructions before attempting to use your
new PonyDocs installation.  Failure to do so will result in frustration and
keyboard tossing.

------- 1) Configure Apache -------

Modify your apache configuration for the use of friendly urls.  Modify your host
to enable rewrite rules.  The following is an example of the apache
configuration, if mediawiki was installed at the base of your html directory.
If your mediawiki instance resides in a sub-directory, modify the configuration
accordingly.

	#################  START SAMPLE APACHE CONFIGURATION #################
	RewriteEngine On
	# Main passthrus
	RewriteRule ^/api.php$	  /api.php	[L,QSA]
	RewriteRule ^/images/(.*)$	  /images/$1  [L,QSA]
	RewriteRule ^/config/(.*)$	  /config/$1  [L,QSA]
	RewriteRule ^/skins/(.*)$	   /skins/$1   [L,QSA]
	RewriteRule ^/extensions/(.*)$  /extensions/$1  [L,QSA]

	# Rewrite /Documentation/ to /Documentation
	RewriteRule ^/Documentation/$   /Documentation  [L,R=301]

	# Rewrite rule to handle passing ugly doc urls to pretty urls
	RewriteRule ^/Documentation:(.*):(.*):(.*):(.*) /Documentation/$1/$4/$2/$3  [L,QSA,R=301]
	RewriteRule ^/Documentation:(.*):(.*):(.*)	  /Documentation/$1/latest/$2/$3  [L,QSA,R=301]

	# get home page requests to Documentation
	RewriteRule ^/$ /Documentation [R]

	# all other requests go to specific page
	RewriteRule ^/(\/*)(.*)$ /index.php?title=$3 [PT,QSA]
	################# END SAMPLE APACHE CONFIGURATION #################

Restart Apache at this time so Rewrite Rules will take affect.

------- 2) Modify LocalSettings.php -------

There are additional user permission flags that are defined.  These are
branchtopic, branchmanual, inherit, viewall.  Modify your $wgGroupPermissions to
add these permissions to your existing groups.  You can also create new groups
for your permissions.  Review http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:User_rights
for more information.  

Some mediawiki instances do not have $wgArticlePath property defined.  Please
make sure this is defined in your LocalSettings.php.  Refer to:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgArticlePath for more information.

Example, if mediawiki was installed at the root of your html directory:

	$wgArticlePath = '/$1';

You'll also need to include the extension itself:

	include_once($IP . "/extensions/PonyDocs/PonyDocsExtension.php");

You should update all the constants here (PONYDOCS_*) to be specific to your 
install.

An example in your LocalSettings.php file, with the two samples above, would be:

	################# PONYDOCS START #################
	// Implicit group for all visitors, removing
	// access beyond reading
	$wgGroupPermissions['*']['createaccount']   = false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit']			= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['*']['createpage']		= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['*']['upload']			= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['*']['reupload']		= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['*']['reupload-shared']	= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['*']['writeapi']		= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['*']['createtalk']		= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['*']['read']			= true;

	// User is a logged.  ensuring they still can't edit.
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['read']			= true;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['createtalk']	= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['upload']		= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['reupload']		= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['reupload-shared'] = false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['edit']			= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['move']			= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['minoredit']	= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['createpage']	= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['writeapi']		= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['move-subpages']= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['move-rootuserpages']= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['purge']		= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['sendemail']	= false;
	$wgGroupPermissions['user']['writeapi']		= false;

	// And our "in charge" group.
	$wgGroupPermissions['bureaucrat']['userrights'] = true;
	 // Custom permission to branch ALL topics for a version.
	$wgGroupPermissions['bureaucrat']['branchall']  = true;

	// Implicit group for accounts that pass $wgAutoConfirmAge
	$wgGroupPermissions['autoconfirmed']['autoconfirmed'] = true;

	// Implicit group for accounts with confirmed email addresses
	// This has little use when email address confirmation is off
	$wgGroupPermissions['emailconfirmed']['emailconfirmed'] = true;

	// Users with bot privilege can have their edits hidden
	// from various log pages by default
	$wgGroupPermissions['bot'  ]['bot']			 = true;
	$wgGroupPermissions['bot'  ]['autoconfirmed']   = true;
	$wgGroupPermissions['bot'  ]['nominornewtalk']  = true;
	$wgGroupPermissions['bot'  ]['autopatrol']	  = true;

	$wgArticlePath = '/$1';

	// Ponydocs environment configuration.  update to your
	// specific install
	define('PONYDOCS_PRODUCT_LOGO_URL', 'http://' . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . str_replace("$1", "", $wgArticlePath) . '/skins/splunk/images/logo_splunkServer_white_rgb.gif');
	define('PONYDOCS_PDF_COPYRIGHT_MESSAGE', 'Copyright Splunk, Inc. All Rights Reserved');
	define('PONYDOCS_DEFAULT_PRODUCT', 'Foo');
	define('PONYDOCS_ENABLE_BRANCHINHERIT_EMAIL', true);

	// NOTE: this *must* match what is in Documentation:Products.
	// This will be fixed in later versions
	$ponyDocsProductsList = array(
			);

	include_once($IP . "/extensions/PonyDocs/PonyDocsExtension.php");
	#################  PONYDOCS END ################# 


-------  3) Install PonyDocs extension and Configure Mediawiki to Load it. -------

Move the extensions/PonyDocs directory into your Mediawiki's extensions directory.

Update your mediawiki database schema by running the schema.sql file in the sql
directory of the PonyDocs extension directory. Remove this sql as it's no longer
needed as is publicly reachable via your ponydocs site.

There is a PonyDocs skin that is provided in this archive.  In order to see
additional Documentation features, you should use this skin by moving the
contents of the skin/ directory (two files and one directory) to
MEDIAWIKIBASE/skins/.  Customize this skin to fit your environment. To activate
the skin, update the wgDefaultSkin value in LocalSettings.php:

	$wgDefaultSkin = 'ponydocs';

-------  4) Have a looksee PonyDocsConfig.php -------

Take a look at the PonyDocs.config.php file  in the Ponydocs extension. It will
define a bunch of constants, most of which you shouldn't need to touch.  As of
this writing, changing these values have not been tested.

-------  5) Define your products in the code. -------

Edit your LocalSettings.php to include a list of products. There is an empty array
already in place called $ponyDocsProductsList. This array *must* be defined before
the PonyDocsExtension is included.  The order in step 2 is correct. This list will
be used to determine user groups. There needs to be at least one defined.  If you
don't define one, PonyDocs will default to a "Splunk" product.  Here is one
product defined (Foo):

	// NOTE: this *must* match what is in Documentation:Products.
	// This will be fixed in later versions
	$ponyDocsProductsList = array(
			'Foo'
		);

And here is three:

	// NOTE: this *must* match what is in Documentation:Products.
	// This will be fixed in later versions
	$ponyDocsProductsList = array(
			'Foo',
			'Bar',
			'Bash',
		);

As well, set your default product to be one of the above, also in LocalSettings.php:

	define('PONYDOCS_DEFAULT_PRODUCT', 'Foo');

------- 6) Add your administrator user to appropriate user groups. -------

Visit your Mediawiki's Special:UserRights page and modify your administrator
user to be added to the *-docteam group based on which products you want to
edit, e.g. Foo-docteam.  Be sure the admin is in the *-docteam for the
PONYDOCS_DEFAULT_PRODUCT as defined in step 5.

------- 7) Create your products on the front-end. -------

Log in as your administrator user and visit the Documentation:Products page.  If
Mediawiki was installed at the base of your documentation root, then simply go
to /Documentation:Products .  Click on the "Create" tab at the top of the page
to edit the page and add new products.

The Documentation:Products page contains a listing of all your products. Each
line defines a single product.  A product definition uses this format:

	{{#product:productShortName|displayName}}

productShortName can be any alphanumeric string (no spaces allowed).
displayName is the human readable name of the product you are documenting. Here's
an example of a page with the three products above:

	{{#product:Foo|Foo for fooing}}
	{{#product:Bar|Bar for the bar}}
	{{#product:Bash|Bash is not Quux}}

Once the page is saved, you'll be able to move to the next step, defining your
versions. As you add more products, add more lines to the Documentation:Products
page. Don't forget to add corresponding elements to the array in
LocalSettings.php, as mentioned in Step 5 above.

------- 8) Create your first product version. -------

Logged in as your administrator user, visit the
Documentation:productShortName:Versions page.  (productShortName is the name of
the product(s) defined above.  If Mediawiki was installed at the base of your
documentation root, then simply go to /Documentation:productShortName:Versions .
Click on the "Create" tab at the top of the page to edit the page and add new
versions.

The Documentation:productShortName:Versions page contains a listing of all
versions of a product, as well as the status of that version.  The status can be
"released", "unreleased" or "preview".  For regular users, only 'released'
versions can be seen.  For documentation teams, all versions can be seen.  There
is also a "productShortName-preview" group which can see preview versions for
that product.  Each line in Documentation:productShortName:Versions must use the
following syntax to define a version:

	{{#version:versionName|status}}

versionName can be any alphanumeric string (no spaces allowed).  It should match
your software's version.  status is either "released", "unreleased" or "preview".
For example, to initialize version 1.0 of your product, have the following line
in your Documentation:productShortName:Versions page:

	{{#version:1.0|unreleased}}

Once the Documentation:productShortName:Versions page is saved, you'll be able
to move to the next step, defining your first manual. As you add more versions
of your product, add more lines to the Documentation:productShortName:Versions
page.

-------  9) Create your first manual. -------

Now head to /Documentation:productShortName:Manuals .  Click on the "Create" tab
at the top of the page to edit the page and add new versions.

The Documentation:productShortName:Manuals page defines the Manuals available
for a product version.  A version can have all the manuals, or a sub-set of the
manuals you define here.  You'll create the links of the manuals to your first
version in the next step.  For now, you'll need to define the first manual.
Each line in Documentation:productShortName:Manuals must use the following
syntax to define a manual:

	{{#manual:manualShortName|displayName}}

manualShortName can be any alphanumeric string (no spaces allowed). For example,
"Installation". displayName is the human readable name of the manual. It can have
spaces and is the full name of the Manual. For example, "Installation Manual".

The following lines create two manuals called Installation and FAQ:

	{{#manual:Installation|Installation Manual}}
	{{#manual:FAQ|FAQ}} 

Once saved, you will see the listing of your manuals.  Each manual name will be
a link to create the Table of Contents for your current version (in this case,
the first version you created in Documentation:productShortName:Versions).  By
clicking on the Manual name, you'll proceed to the next step. 

------- 10) Your 1st Table of Contents (TOC) and auto-gen your first topic -------

Clicking on the Installation Manual link in
Documentation:productShortName:Manuals will have the system direct you to
Documentation:productShortName:InstallationTOC1.0 (if your manual name was
Installation and your first version is 1.0).  TOC pages contain the Table of
Contents of the manual for that version.  The TOC page consists of Section Names
and the topics which reside under those sections.  Click on the "Create" tab at
the top of the TOC page to edit the TOC page. Use the following syntax to create
the TOC for this manual:

	Section Header
	* {{#topic:Topic Title}}

For example:

	Getting Started
	* {{#topic:Before You Begin}}
	* {{#topic:Next Steps}}
	Common problems
	* {{#topic:Disk Permissions}}
	* {{#topic:Database Errors}}

	[[Category:V:productShortName:1.0]]

Note the use of the Category tag inside the TOC, which should have been
autopopulated when the page was created. This will ensure the TOC is linked to
version 1.0.  You must have this category tag present in order for the TOC to
properly render for that version.

When you save the edit to your first TOC page, links to your new topics will
automatically be created.  Clicking on the topic in the TOC page will take you 
to the new topic, which you'll be able to edit with your new content.

Should get you started!  Have fun!

---------------------------------------------
F.A.Q.
---------------------------------------------

Q. Why do I get an error "Table 'ponydocs_doclinks' doesn't exist"?
A. You likely missed running the schema.sql file in step 3.

Q. Why can't I edit or create any docs pages?
A. Go back to step 6 and make sure your user in the in the docs group

Q. I've created all the pages, but the drop down for "product version" or
   "select manual" is empty.  Why?
A. Reset to the backup you made before starting and try again.  Though there are
   some corners you can paint yourself into, this system has been tested and
   should work if you follow the steps in order.
