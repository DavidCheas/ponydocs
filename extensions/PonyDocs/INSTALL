Quick Install Instructions

Modify your apache configuration for the use of friendly urls.  Modify your host to enable rewrite rules.  The following is an example of the apache configuration, if mediawiki was installed at the base of your html directory.  If your mediawiki instance resides in a sub-directory, modify the configuration accordingly.

==== START SAMPLE APACHE CONFIGURATION ====
RewriteEngine On
# Main passthrus
RewriteRule ^/api.php$ 			/api.php 		[L,QSA]
RewriteRule ^/config/(.*)$ 			/config/$1 		[L,QSA]
RewriteRule ^/skins/(.*)$		/skins/$1 	[L,QSA]
RewriteRule ^/extensions/(.*)$ 	/extensions/$1 [L,QSA]

# Rewrite rule to handle passing ugly doc urls to pretty urls
RewriteRule ^/base/Documentation:(.*):(.*):(.*) /base/Documentation/$3/$1/$2 [L,QSA,R=301]
RewriteRule ^/base/Documentation:(.*):(.*) /base/Documentation/latest/$1/$2 [L,QSA,R=301]

# get home page requests to Main_Page
RewriteRule ^/(\/*)$ /index.php?title=Main_Page [PT]
# all other requests go to specific page
RewriteRule ^/(\/*)(.*)$ /index.php?title=$3 [PT,QSA]
==== END SAMPLE APACHE CONFIGURATION ====

Modify your LocalSettings.php file to have an additional namespace of Documentation.  

Example:
$wgExtraNamespaces[100] = "Documentation";

There are additional user permission flags that are defined.  These are branchtopic, branchmanual, inherit, viewall.  Modify your $wgGroupPermissions to add these permissions to your existing groups.  You can also create new groups for your permissions.  Review http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:User_rights for more information.  

An example would be:

$wgGroupPermissions['docteam']['branchtopic']	 = true; // Custom permission to branch a single topic.
$wgGroupPermissions['docteam']['branchmanual']	 = true; // Custom permission to branch an entire manual.
$wgGroupPermissions['docteam']['inherit']		 = true; // Custom permission to inherit a topic.
$wgGroupPermissions['docteam']['viewall']		 = true; // Custom permission to handle View All link for topics.

Some mediawiki instances do not have $wgArticlePath property defined.  Please make sure this is defined in your LocalSettings.php.  Refer to: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgArticlePath for more information.

Example, if mediawiki was installed at the root of your html directory:

$wgArticlePath = '/$1';


Modify the PonyDocs.config.php file in the PonyDocs extension directory to fit your environment.

Update your mediawiki database schema by running the schema.sql file in the sql directory of the PonyDocs extension directory.

There is a PonyDocs skin that is provided in this archive.  In order to see additional Documentation features, you should use this skin.  Customize this skin to fit your environment.
